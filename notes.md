# Notes on nitrogen cycling

Assumptions:

- River-aquifer directly connected
- 1D transport along streamline, simply function of distance from river
- No pyrite for nitrate reduction
- All particulate organic matter already removed (steady state)
- Processes:
  - Aerobic respiration
  - Denitrification
  - Nitrification
  - Aeration
  - Nitrogen outgasing -> similar rate aeration, perhaps compensate volumetric content
- Irrelevant processes:
  - Bioturbation
  - Bioirrigation
  - Molecular diffusion
