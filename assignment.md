# Assignment

The aim of this project is to understand the role of organic matter mineralization in the removal of dissolved organics (DOM) entering the groundwater from a contaminated river.
Specifically, your task is to write a model that can predict the concentrations of DOM, O2, NO3, NH3 and N2 along the flow path of water from the river through the aquifer.
First, you will use the model to fit the given profiles of O2 and NH3 in order to obtain the rate constants of aerobic DOM degradation, nitrification and groundwater aeration.
Then you will apply the model to predict how the quality of potentially drinking water extracted from a well in the aquifer depends on the concentrations of DOM, NO3 and NH3 in the river.

Your ultimate question is: *How does the coupling of processes of aerobic respiration, nitrification-denitrification and groundwater aeration determine water quality along an aquifer adjacent to a river contaminated with organics?*
